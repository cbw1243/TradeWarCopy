Cross validation is important to prevent over-fitting for machine learning models (e.g., lasso, random forest). There has been standard procedures to do cross validation on cross-sectional data, such as k-fold cross validation. Yet, there is no concensus on cross validation for time series data, in which auto-correlation is a key feature. If we apply k-fold cross validation on the time series data, the time series feature embedded in the time series data would be lost. Consequencely, the cross validation will not improve out-of-sample prediction. Thus, the problem is how can we do cross validation on time series data. 

There has been discussions on the issue among data scientists. This following website is one of the discussions that make sense to me. https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscvexample/
There are R examples in the website. You can execute the examples on your own, or use the codes in "TimeSeriesCrossValidation.r" (in section Rob J Hyndman). 

Would you please look into the problem? 

I am writing a tentative solution at Overleaf. This solution is based on the content in the website https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscvexample/. I will certainly need your efforts in improving on the solution.
